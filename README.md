OrePlus
=======

OrePlus is a Bukkit server plugin that modifies the amount of ore generated in the world when new chunks are created, without changing the underlying style of generation.  OrePlus uses the same algorithm for generating deposits as vanilla Minecraft, and can be used to create additional deposits of an ore at different depths or of different sizes.  It can also be used to create deposits of non-ore blocks.  For tighter control, there are configuration options to further restrict where the ore generator is applied, and to optionally clear an area of existing ore blocks before applying new deposits.
